  mutter - command line configuration for Murmur

What it does:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The plan is to have this eventually built static, so that users with very
little needs can trivially administrate a Murmur over Ice from the command
line. It's not intended to replace a full web-admin tool - if your needs are
that great just man-up and install one.

How to Build:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It needs Ice, and a Murmur.ice file from your Murmur src tree. I didn't
include one, because there are checksums now, so you'll want one that
matches your Murmur's slice. Copy Murmur.ice into the build directory, and
type make.

It works with BSD make, untested with gmake right now. Some paths may be
wrong, edit them as necessary. It's set up for FreeBSD ports locations of
Ice and other libs and whatnot.

How it works:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It defaults to connecting to localhost on port 6502. You can change this
with the -h and -p parameters - anything Ice will accept can go here - it
naively copies these parameters into a string and hands it off to
stringToProxy(), so some care is waranted.

-C is used to view and set configuration directives (getConf):

%./mutter -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6502 -C registerurl
registerurl=http://www.example.com

-V is used to set the value of a configuration directive (setConf), and it
requires -C:

%./mutter -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6502 -C registerurl -V http://www.mumble.info
registerurl=http://www.mumble.info

-s sets the server ID. It defaults to 1, and if you aren't virtualhosting
Murmurs, then you probably won't ever need it. It takes a numeric ID.

Where to report bugs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm usually on #mumble on freenode as fwaggle. You could start there.

Note that some of it may not be bugs - this isn't intended to do anything
other than naively send messages across Ice. Check you're handing the right
value to Ice first.
